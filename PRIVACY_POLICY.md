# Privacy Policy for IITG Wi-Fi Auto Login

**Last updated:** October 6, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the "IITG Wi-Fi Auto Login" extension (the "Extension") handles your data. Your privacy and security are our top priorities.

### 1. The Single Purpose of the Extension

The Extension has one single purpose: to automatically log you into the IITG (Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati) campus Wi-Fi captive portal. It is designed as a "set-it-and-forget-it" utility to improve your internet experience on campus.

### 2. Information We Collect and Store

To function, the Extension requires you to provide your **IITG Username** and **IITG Password**.

This is the only personal information the Extension collects. This information is stored exclusively on your local device.

### 3. How We Use and Protect Your Information

* **Authentication:** Your username and password are used for the sole purpose of submitting the login form on the IITG Wi-Fi captive portal (`agnigarh.iitg.ac.in`).
* **Local, Encrypted Storage:** Your credentials are never stored in plain text. They are encrypted on your local machine using the browser's built-in Web Crypto API and a unique key derived for your installation. This means your credentials are not accessible to other applications or users.
* **No Data Transmission:** Your credentials are **never** sent to or stored on any external servers, third-party services, or cloud storage. They are only sent directly to the IITG Wi-Fi portal during the login process.

### 4. How the Extension Operates (Use of Permissions)

To provide a seamless experience, the Extension uses several browser permissions:

* **Host Permissions (`agnigarh.iitg.ac.in`, `connectivitycheck.gstatic.com`)**: The Extension needs to interact with the IITG Wi-Fi portal to submit your login details. It also checks standard connectivity URLs to reliably detect when a captive portal is active and a login is required. No data is collected from these checks.
* **Storage**: This permission is used to securely save your encrypted credentials and settings (e.g., whether the service is paused) on your device.
* **Alarms**: This permission is used to run periodic checks in the background. These checks determine if your Wi-Fi session is still active or if a re-login is needed, preventing sudden connection drops. This is essential for the automatic renewal feature.
* **Notifications**: This permission is used only for critical alerts. For example, if a login fails because your credentials are incorrect, the Extension will send a notification prompting you to update them in the options menu. We do not use notifications for marketing or promotional purposes.

### 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy
